  I also make game programming tutorials on YouTube. Go sub to <a href="https://youtube.com/@jslegenddev" target="_blank">my channel</a>! (If you like the content)
  You'll learn how I built this portfolio you're currently playing through!`,

  Text is rendered with HTML/CSS. So the textbox you're currently reading is not rendered within canvas. Learn more about how to use
  Kaboom.js by watching some of my tutorials <a href="https://youtube.com/@jslegenddev" target="_blank">here</a>.`,
  library: `There are a lot of books on my shelves. There is even one in French (I also speak French btw).
  I probably only read one of them. Who else compulsively buys technical books without ever finishing them?`,
